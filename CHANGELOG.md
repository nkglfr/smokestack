# Changelog

Versions are published as signed releases; servers with automatic updates
install the newest one directly, whatever versions came in between.

## 0.2.3

- **Fixed: pages could be served stale from a cache.** The metadata injected
  into the public pages changes with every measurement, but the pages still
  carried the version-wide `ETag`, so a browser or a proxy could be told
  "not modified" and show an outdated description or summary.
- **Pasted hosts are cleaned**: leading tabs or spaces, a whole URL, brackets
  around an IPv6 address, a trailing dot and invisible characters no longer
  create a target that can never be measured. What cannot be a host is
  refused with the reason.
- The ready-made targets drop `pool.ntp.org` and offer French **university
  time servers** instead (Sorbonne, Lyon 1 in IPv4 and IPv6, Caen, Nice), all
  with a stable address.
- **The public page explains a load-balanced target**: a name answering from
  several addresses carries a notice above its figures — different servers,
  possibly in different places and under different loads — with the addresses
  seen, in the ten languages, and in the description read by search engines.
  A pinned target says so instead.
- **Rotating names are detected**: a target whose name answered from several
  addresses in 24 hours is flagged in the back-office, with a button to pin
  the address actually measured. A pool name such as `fr.pool.ntp.org` points
  at a different server every few minutes, so its graph mixed machines and
  silent servers looked like packet loss.
- **Fixed: replies that do not echo our payload were counted as lost**
  (issue #9). The send time only travelled inside the packet, and a reply
  shorter than 16 bytes, or one whose payload the target rewrote, was thrown
  away — several home routers, CPE and ONT answer exactly like that, which is
  why `ping` saw those targets while smokestack reported 100 % loss. The probe
  now keeps the send time on its side and accepts a bare 8-byte reply.
- **A failing target now says why** (issue #9): the back-office shows, under
  its name, whether the name could not be resolved, whether IPv6 is missing on
  the probe, or that nothing replied — with the address actually probed. The
  reason disappears as soon as the target answers again.

- The home page checkbox is now simply **Unique targets**, with a blue marker
  whose tooltip explains what it does (issue #8).
- **Public pages are indexable.** Title, description, canonical address,
  language alternates, social cards and structured data on every page, plus a
  summary readable without JavaScript. Each target gets a readable address
  `/t/<name>`, `/sitemap.xml` lists the public pages and targets, and
  `/robots.txt` keeps crawlers out of the back-office and the API. One switch
  in the publisher page turns it all off. Private targets are never exposed.

## 0.2.2

- **Fixed: editing a target saved only part of it.** The category, interval,
  spacing and timeout were silently ignored (issue #7). Every field is now
  saved, and a test sets and reads back all of them.
- **Fixed: the back-office was unusable on a phone** (issue #6). The menu
  slides over the page and closes when a screen is chosen; the target list
  shows one card per target with its buttons reachable; wide tables scroll
  instead of being cut off.
- The host and the category appear under each target's name.

## 0.2.1

- **Contact form** on the public *About* page: visitors write from the site
  and messages land in the back-office, so the operator's address stays off
  spam lists. Rate-limited, with a bot trap and header-injection checks.
- **Mobile menu** on the public pages: the links were cut off and unreachable
  below 760 px.
- Link from the ready-made targets to the project wiki, which collects
  suggested targets per country.
- Each target is shown once on the home page instead of up to three times; a
  checkbox restores the previous behaviour.
- A catalogue of ready-made targets (public resolvers in IPv4 and IPv6, HTTPS
  endpoints, NTP pool) to enable in one click.
- **Container image** `ghcr.io/nkglfr/smokestack`, for tests, with its
  disclaimer: the host network is mandatory, and a container has no signed
  in-place updates. The service detects containers and says what is degraded.

## 0.2.0

- **Edit a target** from the back-office, and manage categories (rename,
  delete).
- A new target is **measured right away** instead of waiting a whole interval;
  **Check now** repeats that on demand.
- **Separate host and port** for TCP targets, with the usual ports suggested.
- **Install it now** button when a new version is available.
- Working browser Back button, clickable logo, and several back-office fixes.

## 0.1.4

- **Private targets**: measured and visible in the back-office, never on the
  public pages or in the public API.
- The installer asks for the listen IP and port on a first installation
  (`--yes` skips the questions).

## 0.1.3

- Public pages in **ten languages**: English, Danish, Dutch, French, German,
  Italian, Norwegian Bokmål, Portuguese, Spanish and Swedish.
- `smokestack languages` lists them and sets the default; `--lang` at install.

## 0.1.2

- The listen address moves to `/etc/smokestack/smokestack.env`
  (`SMOKESTACK_LISTEN_IP`, `SMOKESTACK_LISTEN_PORT`), with `-ip` and `-port`
  flags. Versions 0.1.1 and earlier do not read that file: after a rollback to
  one of them, the address in `config.json` applies, or the default
  `127.0.0.1:8080`.
- Update checks move to **once a day** by default, configurable from one hour
  to a month.
- English design notes (`docs/DESIGN.md`), screenshots in the README.

## 0.1.1

Same code as 0.1.0: the tag was pushed before the changes. Use 0.1.2 or later.

## 0.1.0

First public release: latency and loss measurement with exact percentiles,
ICMP and TCP over IPv4 and IPv6, traceroute on anomalies compared with the
last healthy path, public status pages, private back-office, federation
between operators, signed in-place updates with automatic rollback.
